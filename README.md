# Conq_'s Infernum

One of the things I noticed while looking through BTA mods is the very distinct lack of mods with mobs.
My goal with this mod was just to add a simple, yet interesting addition to BTA enemies, filling in
the empty niche of minibosses with something that I feel fits the Beta style. 

This mod allows any enemy that extends EntityMonster (as in Zombies, Creepers, Spiders, Skeletons, Scorpions, but not things like Slimes)
to rarely spawn as an Infernum enemy, boasting 3x health, 2.5X speed, 2X damage, and a short-ranged fireball attack that increases over time. 

When killed these mobs drop treasure as well as Infernum.

Infernum can be used to craft Nether Coal when used with Nether ingredients.
